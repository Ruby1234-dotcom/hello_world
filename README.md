Personal Profile:
1.Results for Myers Briggs test: 
Protagonist - ENFJ-T "Protagonists are genuine, caring people who talk the talk and walk the walk, and nothing makes them happier than leading the charge, uniting and motivating their team with infectious enthusiasm," (16Personalities, 2019)

If you are an VISUAL learner, you may wish to find out more about what you can do to maximize your learning potential. (Whatismylearningstyle.com, 2019)


3.A Random online test: Emotional Intelligence test
Your Score: 12/20- Your score places you around the average at reading expressions. And research suggests that people can improve their emotion recognition skills with practice.  (Greater Good, 2019)

The fact that I am a protagonist allows me to lead well and show responsibility in a team environment. I am able to focus on the end goal and take charge of a group of people allowing for a successful group. I am a visual learner which is the most popular learning style which makes me able to learn quickly and among most others making new skills and techniques come to me quickly therefore allowing for a strong team finish time. I am OK at reading expressions therefore am able to read my group members facial expressions when leading which is a good asset considering I often lead. Knowing there expression may allow me to be empathetic and know when to step back and let others produce ideas. 

PROJECT IDEA
OVERVIEW: 
The projects purpose is to provide equal opportunities for women by educating modern technologies with free access, regardless of barriers such as poverty and gender discrimination. The project will allow women to learn modern technologies increasing the chances of them gaining work in a contemporary workplace. The education will be online and be provide an opportunity for women to upskill their current technology skills. With the workforce changing and demand for an understanding of technology expected, we must ensure there is equal opportunities for both men and women. 

MOTIVATION:
Currently in the United Kingdom (UK), the government is providing a “digital strategy” which aims to develop everyone’s skills to ensure positive opportunities in the workforce. (Global Citizen, 2019) It is not just the mediocre mind that thinks about the skills required to attain a job in the current economy. From high end jobs to jobs at the other end of the sector, i.e. Uber drivers, patrons need technology skills. This is why it is vital that a) access is given to all for this project and b) Patrons are educated on the basic skills one would need from using an iPad, to printing, to using excel etcetera. If people have free access to anything, they are more likely take the opportunity over having to pay to learn. 

DESCRIPTION:
Free education is motivating for people and having offline access to tutorials via computers, tablets etc, people will more likely access the education. Thus further allowing opportunities to the busy and the disadvantaged such as stay at home women with children and people who are geographically dispersed etc. People are able to attend public libraries, schools, universities to access the information via tablets, computers, screens provided for free.

As well as the disadvantaged, some people are motivated to learn but simply cannot afford to train or are anxious to show up to in house training. As well as this there is a real lack of knowledge on where to gain these skills and where training is accessed. I think there’s a real stigma around education being expensive.  Having access to an online/offline free service will remove these barriers for all. As most features of the website are online, people are recommended to nearby libraries, schools and universities upon sign up, where access to free WIFI is available. This allows patrons to download the tutorials onto phones, tablets and laptops and therefore learn offline when at home or simply away from WIFI. 

After sign up is complete, a series of questions will be presented to patrons allowing them to find out what exactly they want to gain from the program. The questions are presented in simple language that the majority can understand this further allowing the demographic of people using the program to be large. Once patrons have answered questions they are on their way and are able to get started educating themselves on the positives of learning such tools as well as nearby job opportunities. 

The education then starts and patrons will work through different tutorials and readings varying from what they want to learn. The option for offline tutorials and printed readings will be presented so that access is available for all. There is no limit to what patrons can learn, if starting low and moving to experienced technologies such as coding, all is allowed with unlimited access for people ten and above.
 
TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES:
Technologies - The technology is frequently updated for viruses and there is a nine until five contactable help line where people are able to ask questions and present possible errors. This is to ensure that the program is safe. I think it would be suffice to provide an automated help button on the website where frequent answers can be answered by an online “bot”. Training is available from ten and above therefore removing any possible errors that children might find. The technology is accessible to all and made as easy as it can be with only a click needed through reading material and tutorials. No typing is required or communication.  The open source is obvious and that is the help line. As well as this there are meet up groups, nation-wide, where patrons can meet up with tutors and discuss real life questions and network with other learners. 
Tools - Although no tool is initially required, it is recommended that patrons have access to local libraries, universities, schools etc. This as well as either a computer, a tablet and a phone. 

SKILLS REQUIRED:The main skills required to make this possible is volunteers to help be in the tutorials. I will need motivated people looking to help the community advance their skills which may be difficult. The other difficulty is access to WIFI and computer technologies. However 87% of the Australian population is connected, we have put steps in place for the unconnected. The software that needs to be written is making the website and making it easily read for patrons etc. 

OUTCOME:With men having 12% more access to qualified jobs, it is important that we provide women with an equal opportunity to learn and become skill sufficient in technology that is used in the contemporary workplace. Providing an offline/ online free service will create opportunities for not only women but the disadvantaged to access skills and use those skills in a job setting. Not only this but provide education to the elderly and young adults in skills that “everyday” tech nuts use.
